Welcome to my personal homepage. I hold a PhD in [Computational Social Science](http://www.css.gmu.edu/) from George Mason University. I specialize in simulation techniques applied to macroeconomics and  finance. I currently work as a computational economist at the [Office of Financial Research](https://www.financialresearch.gov/) in the U.S. Treasury. *Please note: all opinions expressed here are my own and do not represent those of the Office of Financial Research, U.S. Treasury, or any other potentilly affiliated organizations.*

## Research

My [research page](/pages/research) outlines my current publications and work in progress.

## Notebooks

My [notebooks](/pages/Notebooks) are a simple collection of ideas and resources, spanning a wide range to topics. These exist as a "scratchwork area" to store things I personally find useful or interesting. If you find them useful as well, excellent! (And if you feel anything useful is missing, feel free to send a reference.)

## Teaching

I have enjoyed teaching computational supplements in [Econ 838](https://ices.gmu.edu/academics/courses) and [CSS 739](http://www.css.gmu.edu/~axtell/Rob/Teaching.html).

My material for parametric and non-parametric statistics for Econ 838 is only available to students who have taken the course or obtained special permission from the instructor.

My crash course in dynamic programming for CSS 739 may be available upon request.


## Blog

My blog (which is updated somewhat infrequently) can be found [here](/#blog).


## Interests

Aside from [computational economics](http://www.comp-econ.org/) and [agent-based](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-sieJVR5TI) [modeling](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm), I thoroughly enjoy being outdoors. As a native South Texan, I miss Tex-Mex and "western ballroom" (two-step, waltz, polka, swing). I recently discovered that some activities I enjoyed in undergrad are nowadays described as "freerunning" or "[parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour)." I'm certainly not in shape enough for that now, but I'd love to get into it again someday...

On an academic note, I really enjoy [programming and computational approaches](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html), and the [mathematics](http://johnstachurski.net/maths.html) needed to understand and use computational models.  

I strongly believe that agent-based modeling is simply the next step in computational economic modeling, incorporating insights from software engineering to construct models that "trace out" the effects of "well tested theory" (to use [Kydland and Prescott's](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.10.1.69) terminology). 

Agent-based models often relax optimization in favor of "something else." Ongoing research in areas such as [boundedly rational dynamic programming](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17783), [Q-learning & related tools](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/aemind.htm), and [N-Period-ahead learning](http://ideas.repec.org/p/ore/uoecwp/2010-15.html) are just a few examples possible alternative behaviors which have a solid theoretical foundation. Another approach, of course, is to "mix" some optimal and non-optimal behavior, either in a single agent (as in Laibson et al.'s  [Natural Expectations](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.24.4.67), which is begging to be combined with a Bayesian approach a la [fictive learning](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/22/9493.full) ) or in a population of agents (as in [Lansing](http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/staff.php?klansing)'s [work](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CEF2012&paper_id=329) and [Wouter den Haan](http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/)'s [work](http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/numerical/boundedrationalityslides.pdf)). Beyond these approaches, of course, are econometric and statistical learning approaches, game-theoretic approaches, and AI and evolutionary approaches. For me an ideal outcome of these processes is a modular learning and expectations-formation procedures that are well-understood both at the individual level as well as at the aggregate level, which may then be used in any number of large-scale simulations.

At the end of the day, we want to discover the simplest, theoretically well-understood learning processes which closely match household and individual behavior. We want "econometric rationality" -- a convex combination of a few simple learning models which give us zero error in expectation when forecasting population behavior. I strongly suspect that the "true structural parameters" which fulfill the Lucas Critique will in fact be learning parameters as well as preference parameters.
