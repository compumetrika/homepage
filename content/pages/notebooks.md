This is simple collection of hypertext notebooks, unabashedly inspired by Cosma Shalizi's [excellent collection](http://bactra.org/notebooks/). I find myself frequently jotting down ideas on tiny scraps of paper, napkins, etc., always to be lost in the shuffle. This is a simple way to collect those in one place. At a minimum, these are simple lists of references to resources I've found useful for a particular topic. 

These are organized ~~alphabetically~~ by my personal interest, and all will almost certainly be in a continual state of update:

- [Agent Based Modeling](/pages/research-notebooks/ABM)
    - Also, "[So you want to build an ABM](/pages/research-notebooks/So-You-Want-To-Build-an-ABM)"
- [Dynamic Programming](/pages/research-notebooks/DynamicProgramming)
- [Learning and Expectations](/pages/research-notebooks/Learning-and-Expectations)
