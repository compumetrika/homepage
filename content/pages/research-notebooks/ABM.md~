I strongly believe that agent-based modeling is simply the next step in computational economic modeling, incorporating insights from software engineering to construct models that "trace out" the effects of "well tested theory" (to use [Kydland and Prescott's](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.10.1.69) terminology). 

Agent-based models often relax optimization in favor of "something else." Ongoing research in areas such as [boundedly rational dynamic programming](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17783), [Q-learning & related tools](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/aemind.htm), and [N-Period-ahead learning](http://ideas.repec.org/p/ore/uoecwp/2010-15.html) are just a few examples possible alternative behaviors which have a solid theoretical foundation. Another approach, of course, is to "mix" some optimal and non-optimal behavior, either in a single agent (as in Laibson et al.'s  [Natural Expectations](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/jep.24.4.67), which is begging to be combined with a Bayesian approach a la [fictive learning](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/22/9493.full) ) or in a population of agents (as in [Lansing](http://www.frbsf.org/economics/economists/staff.php?klansing)'s [work](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CEF2012&paper_id=329) and [Wouter den Haan](http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/)'s [work](http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/numerical/boundedrationalityslides.pdf)). Beyond these approaches, of course, are econometric and statistical learning approaches, game-theoretic approaches, and AI and evolutionary approaches. For me an ideal outcome of these processes is a modular learning and expectations-formation procedures that are well-understood both at the individual level as well as at the aggregate level, which may then be used in any number of large-scale simulations.
