At the end of the day, we want to discover the simplest (in a "number of parameters" sense), theoretically well-understood learning processes which closely match household and individual behavior. We want "econometric rationality" -- white noise error between the model of learning and people's behavior in practice. I strongly suspect that the "true structural parameters" which fulfill the Lucas Critique will in fact be learning parameters as well as preference parameters.
