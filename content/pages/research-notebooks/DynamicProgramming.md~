Dynamic programming is a broad set of methods for solving hard / complicated problems by recusively breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and solving those. The method is used widely in economics to solve optimization problems associated with agent choice (as reflected in [Sargent's "Imperialism of recursive methods" preface](https://books.google.com/books?id=Xx-j-tYaPQUC&lpg=PR5&vq=imperialism&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false) ).

### Resources: 

Simply a collection of resources I have personally found useful. I make no claim that these represent an exhaustive survey. In addition to the "typical" dynamic programming texts, the following are some slightly less common resources for DP in economics.  

- [Reinforcement Learning](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html) by Sutton and Barto. See Chapters 3 and 4 for an excellent entry-level discussion of the dynamic programming framework. 
- Adda/Cooper
- Chris Carroll's electronic notes
- Bertsekas, Abstract DP and many resources
- Powell, Approx DP
- Jose Vidal, Multiagent Systems
