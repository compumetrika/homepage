# Work in Progress

#### Palmer, N. M. (2017), Estimation and Selection in Micro-Structural Model of Consumption

* A structural microeconomic estimation of the fraction of rule-of-thumb households versus life cycle optimizing households in micro data. Initial results are consistent with roughly 50% of households following a rule of thumb, a structural microeconomic echo of Campbell and Mankiw's ([1989](http://www.nber.org/papers/w2924), [1990](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/besjnlbes/v_3a8_3ay_3a1990_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a265-79.htm) ) result. 

* Draft in progress. 


#### Palmer, N. M. (2017), Learning to Dynamically Optimize from Individual Experience

* A theoretical model of households learning the optimal consumption-savings problem from their own experience. This draws from the recent [approximate dynamic programming](http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/dpchapter.html) and [reinforcement learning](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning) literatures to develop a relatively fast, low-parameter, intuitive learning mechanism based on individual agent's "regret" regarding past decisions. 

* Presented at [CEF 2016](https://editorialexpress.com/conference/CEF2016/program/CEF2016.html).

* Draft in progress, nearly complete. 

#### Carroll, Kaufman, Low, Palmer, White (2017), "[Heterogeneous Agents Resources and toolKit (HARK)](https://github.com/econ-ark/HARK)"

* A toolkit for creating heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models using the [Krusell-Smith (1998)](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/250034?journalCode=jpe) solution algorithm, household life-cycle optimization, and simulation-based estimation. 
    * Because the Krusell-Smith algorithm can be used to solve models which contain a mix of optimizing and non-optimizing agents (as seen in their earlier 1996 paper, ""), I intend to use this to explore models which mix elements of traditional and agent-based models.  


#### Palmer, N. M. (2012), Learning to Consume: Social Learning

* A simple model of households learning the optimal consumption-savings problem from the experience of others. Think replicator dynamics, but with estimates of infinite-horizon value functions. 

* This social learning consumption research [presented](http://editorialexpress.com/conference/CEF2012/program/CEF2012.html#31) at [CEF 2012](http://comp-econ.org/CEF_2012/index.htm).
    * Very preliminary version of the paper is [linked here](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CEF2012&paper_id=450); an _**extensively**_ updated version is in progress and will be out any day now...
