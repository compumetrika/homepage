## Publications & Work in Progress


* Geanakoplos et al (2012), "Getting at Systemic Risk via an Agent-Based Model of the Housing Market." _American Economic Review_, 102(3): 53â€“58.
    * Efforts to address agent behavior in this highly complicated setting motivated my dissertation research.
    * Paper [here](http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.102.3.53)
    * More in Peter Howitt's Session 2 [here](http://bfi.uchicago.edu/events/macro-financial-modeling-meeting-spring-2013); in particular, see the discussion by Sufi, Sims, Cochrane, Hansen, and others. Cochrane's questions in particular are what I hope to address in my own research. ([Archived](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://bfi.uchicago.edu/events/macro-financial-modeling-meeting-spring-2013).)
    * Rob Axtell discusses this model briefly near the end of [this talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-sieJVR5TI), around 12:40.
    * Updated versions:
        * Slides, [2014](https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Bundesbank/Research_Centre/Conferences/2014/2014_06_04_eltville_08_agent_based_model_of_housing_market_bubble_presentation.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)
        * Paper, [2014](https://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Bundesbank/Research_Centre/Conferences/2014/2014_06_05_eltville_10_axtell.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)

* My consumption research [presented](http://editorialexpress.com/conference/CEF2012/program/CEF2012.html#31) at [CEF 2012](http://comp-econ.org/CEF_2012/index.htm).
    * Very preliminary version of the paper is [linked here](https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=CEF2012&paper_id=450); an _**extensively**_ updated version is in progress and will be out any day now...
    * CEF Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYXRoYW5tcGFsbWVyfGd4OjEzNTYzNzExMTExMTAyMGE).

* The Heterogeneous-Agent Resources toolKit (HARK) with Chris Carroll, Matt White, David Low, and many others: an effort to bring together cutting-edge tools from research and software development to create a modular, extensible set of code libraries for the easy creation of heterogeneous-agent, micro-founded models. These are to include models in which some "alpha" fraction of truly rational agents are mixed in with (1-alpha) non-optimizing agents. A truly rational agent in this setting, of course, must anticipate the actions and outcomes of both the non-optimizing agents as well as the optimizing agents.
    * This is a particularly exciting project -- much more coming soon!
