This is simple collection of hypertext notebooks, unabashedly inspired by Cosma Shalizi's [excellent collection](http://bactra.org/notebooks/). I find myself frequently jotting down ideas on tiny scraps of paper, napkins, etc., always to be lost in the shuffle. This is a simple way to collect those in one place. 

These are organized alphabetically, and all will almost certainly be in a continual state of update. 

## Notebooks

- [Agent-Based Modeling](/pages/research-notebooks/ABM), or, "So you want to build an ABM..."
