Welcome to my personal homepage. I hold a PhD in [Computational Social Science](http://www.css.gmu.edu/) from George Mason University and currently currently work as a computational economist at the [Office of Financial Research](https://www.financialresearch.gov/) in the U.S. Treasury.\*

## Areas of Expertise

I specialize in simulation techniques applied to macroeconomics and finance, household finance, and a wide range of related subjects. The statistical tools needed to understand and construct these models are also a key interest of mine. 

There is a tremendous amount of computing power and data available to us these days. I work on methods that bring together "big data" and "big computation" to address research questions. One of these tools is [agent-based models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) (ABM). My research addresses fundamental questions associated with this class of model, including: 

- Where does agent behavior come from? 
- How do you get prices?
- How do you estimate these models?

The answers to these questions come from the economic and applied mathematics literatures, and include:

- Behavior: adaptive approximate optimization
- Prices: any number of market structures - clearing, search, matching, N-lateral trade, market makers, etc.
- Estimation: simulation-based inference.

I thoroughly enjoy the programming and computational methods required to answer these questions and the [mathematics](http://johnstachurski.net/maths.html) needed to understand and use computational models. These topics are covered further in my research pages and notebooks. 


## Research

My [research page](/pages/research) outlines my publications and work in progress.

## Notebooks

My [notebooks](/pages/notebooks) are a simple collection of ideas and resources, spanning a wide range to topics. These exist as a "scratchwork area" to store things I personally find useful or interesting. If you find them useful as well, excellent! (And if you feel anything useful is missing, feel free to send a reference.)

## Teaching

I have enjoyed teaching computational supplements in [Econ 838](https://ices.gmu.edu/academics/courses) and [CSS 739](http://www.css.gmu.edu/~axtell/Rob/Teaching.html).

My material for parametric and non-parametric statistics for Econ 838 is only available to students who have taken the course or obtained special permission from the instructor.

My crash course in dynamic programming for CSS 739 may be available upon request.


## Blog

My blog (which is updated infrequently) can be found [here](/#blog).


## Interests

Aside from [computational economics](http://www.comp-econ.org/) and [agent-based](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-sieJVR5TI) [modeling](http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ace.htm), I thoroughly enjoy being outdoors. As a native South Texan, I miss Tex-Mex and "western ballroom" (two-step, waltz, polka, swing). I recently discovered that some activities I enjoyed in undergrad are nowadays described as "freerunning" or "[parkour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour)." I'm certainly not in shape enough for that now, but I'd love to get into it again someday...

On an academic note, I really enjoy [programming and computational approaches](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html), and the [mathematics](http://johnstachurski.net/maths.html) needed to understand and use computational models.
